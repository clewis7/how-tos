# Installing `Arch Linux`

> **_NOTE:_**  I installed this on a 2024 Lenovo Yoga i9 for dual boot with Windows and Linux.

## Step 1: Shrink Windows SSD (`C:`) disk partition 
Can do this using Disk Manager GUI in Windows. Have 1TB of memory, so shrunk data chunk by about half to create a large file system for my Linux side. 

## Step 2: Create an Arch Linux installation image
Take a 32GB USB memory stick, download and Arch Linux ISO image, and burn the image using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) to create a bootable drive. 

## Step 3: Boot into live image and install
